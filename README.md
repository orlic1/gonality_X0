The codes from the article "Gonality of the modular curve X_0(N)" by F. Najman and P. Orlić

Each file is a code for the one value of N. The files are sorted into folders by methods used in the code.

new_models.m contains auxiliary functions. The most important one there is eqs_quos, which gives models for Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N).

Betti_numbers folder contains codes for Proposition 5.25.
Fp_gonality folder contains codes for Proposition 5.15 and Corollary 5.19 (for N=173).
Mordell-Weil_sieving contains codes for Proposition 6.1.
Riemann-Roch_search contains codes for Propositions 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4.
trigonality_checks.m contains codes for Propositions 5.2, 5.8, and 5.16.
